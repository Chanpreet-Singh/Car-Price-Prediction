## Predicting Used Car Prices using Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks
---
### Abstract
---
The widespread increase in the car market industry makes it difficult for newly manufactured cars to reach buyers for several reasons. Several factors include heavy car costs for both used and newly manufactured cars, factors such as a lack of supply, finances, and others. As a result, the used automobile industry is growing rapidly all over the world, But in the outside world, the used car industry is majorly managed by the private sector. This creates the potential for deception when purchasing a used automobile. Thus, a very accurate model that can predict the cost of a used car without favoring either the consumer or the merchandiser, or any other entity is a must. This project aims in building a Machine Learning model using both a supervised modeling approach and a deep neural network (DNN) approach. We have developed a working model using several supervised algorithms as well as a DNN algorithm and obtained the models with the least error value, after which, we have compared these models to find the best optimal model to predict the used car prices. For this project, we have used Craigslist Dataset which consists of data related to used cars. A DNN model is built using the dataset as well as several supervised algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Light GBM. The results showed that out of all Random Forest performed the best on the dataset with an R2 Score value of 0.85, as well as the Mean Absolute Percentage Error on the test data, which was around 17 percent. Additionally, as the dataset gets updated the model can perform more effective results and help in devising the used car sales startegy.
